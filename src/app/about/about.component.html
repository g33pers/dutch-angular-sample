<p>This demo project consists of routing for three pages with a data service that returns json data in lieu of an API call.</p>
<p>Styling and UI components taken from the PrimeNG library.</p>
<p>The project itself is based around elements of a spaced repetition language learning app with a page showing current user progress via word strength and when words are due for revision.</p>
